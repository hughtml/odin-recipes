        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Goat cheese is baked with marinara sauce and topped with fresh basil to make this super easy appetizer in a flash! Serve fresh out of the oven with crostini or garlic bread for dipping.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border, taking care to cover the edge of goat cheese but not the middle. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and marinara sauce is hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil.</li>
        </ol>
