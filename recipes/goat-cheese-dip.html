        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <ul>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log</li>
                <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="content-section">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border, taking care to cover the edge of goat cheese but not the middle. Sprinkle with salt.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and marinara sauce is hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil.</li>
            </ol>
