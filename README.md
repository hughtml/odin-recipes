# odin-recipes
This is the first HTML assignment for the Odin Project - a recipes page. It will consist of a main page with links to recipes. It is designed to improve HTML skills rather than CSS.

Following the completion of the HTML assignment and moving into the CSS module, the assignment involves getting used to CSS by adding some to this project. Visual aesthetic has never been a strong point of mine, but I already feel more comfortable with CSS at this stage.
